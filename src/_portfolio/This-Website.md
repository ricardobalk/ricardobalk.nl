> Big update! (August 2019) &mdash; I redesigned my website again and I now use Webpack, Vue components, npm, Docker, Netlify etc. [Learn more about this update...](#august-2019)

After I [graduated](/portfolio/vormkracht10-ux) for my Bachelor of Science in Communication &amp; Multimedia Design, I wanted to work on my online presence and my career towards being an UX/UI designer / front-end developer. So the first thing I did was to [create my own website]({{site.baseurl}}/portfolio/my-website).

I wanted to create a website that gives an impression of my identity, my works and my ambitions. It should be open source and easy to maintain as well. All content of my website will be in English because it reaches the most people.

## What is going to be found on this website?

On my website, you'll find some information about me, writings on my blog and a portfolio with impressions of projects I've worked on in the past.

On the blog I write about a variety of subjects, assorted into categories. Subjects you could expect include graphic design, front-end development, computer software, electronics, and conferences.

## How long did it take to build an own website?

It took about 6 weeks before the first version of my website went live. If you'd like to break down the work to pieces, it took about one week for the ideation phase, two weeks for creating more fine-grained visual designs and three weeks to write the code.

### The phases explained

The ideation phase consists of brainstorming, defining the project scope, and determining the information architecture. All of this came together in some initial sketches &ndash; also called low-fidelity wireframes.

After the ideation phase was finished, a rough design of the project was determined and that became the input for more fine-grained designs. Alternative approaches were considered, decisions were made, higher-fidelity wireframes were created and all of this together became the input for the visual designs.

The visual designs were created with the 12 coloms grid in mind. The next thing to do was to transform my visual designs to working code fit it to the system I wanted to use.

But remember, it is *an ongoing project*, so I will keep working on it and it will never be 'finished'.

## Why did you build it on your own and didn't you use a blogging platform like WordPress?

There are many, many reasons.

- **Geekyness** &mdash; I'm a geek.
- **Coolness** &mdash; Using WordPress would not be as cool as saying that I created all this stuff on my own.
- **Expandability** &mdash; I can expand my website with fancy stuff when I want to.
- **Collaboration** &mdash; Others could help (re)write parts of my articles by sending a pull request on GitHub. I learn from others, others learn from me.
- **Awesomeness** &mdash; Git is awesome. Especially when you like to work on stuff with an iterative approach. Just create multiple branches and go!
- **Proudness** &mdash; I'm just proud of taking different approaches and to create something out of nothing. That's probably part of my character.

## Where's the source code?

It's on [GitHub](https://github.com/ellipticcurv3/www).

## What's next?

I already mentioned that my website is an ever ongoing project and would never be finished, because there's always something that could be better. There is a [public To Do list](/todo) available where you could see which steps I'd like to take in the future.

## Updates

### August 2019

I did an entire redesign of my website to make it more visually appealing and showing what I'm worth. I also took my websites' techniques to a higher level.

Thanks to Node Package Manager (`npm`) I don't have to worry about _managing dependencies_, thanks to Webpack I could easily _pack_ my websites' source code into one, big _bundle_, thanks to Vue I can focus on designing individual _components_ instead of _pages_ (Atomic Design), thanks to Docker I don't have to worry about different development environments and thanks to Netlify my live website gets updated on each change.

In a nutshell &mdash; My website is more visually appealing, it operates more smoothly and the development takes less time. Awesome!
